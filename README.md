Bossing Kamusta ang Buhay Buhay🫡

Pio Nicolai Bacani,
an 18-year-old first-year college student at the University of the Cordilleras.
I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
I have a strong passion for learning how to code and am always looking to advance my knowledge of various programming languages.🤘
Besides academics, I enjoy unwinding with a drink every now and then, as I find it a great way to relax.🤟
Looking forward to honing my coding skills and exploring the world of technology even further!😘
😘🤟🫰🤘😘😘😘😍🥰🥰🥰😘😘
